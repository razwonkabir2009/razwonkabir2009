- ⚡ Fun fact: The very first computer mouse wasn't made of sleek plastic or metal like the ones we use today. Believe it or not, the first computer mouse in 1964, invented by Doug Engelbart, was made of wood! It had two wheels perpendicular to each other, allowing for cursor movement on the screen.  It wasn't the most ergonomic design, but it paved the way for the innovative mice we use extensively today.
